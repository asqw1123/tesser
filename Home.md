# Tesseract at UB Mannheim

The Mannheim University Library (UB Mannheim) uses Tesseract to perform text recognition (OCR = optical character recognition)
for historical German newspapers ([Allgemeine Preu√üische Staatszeitung](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allgemeine_Preu%C3%9Fische_Staatszeitung), [Deutscher Reichsanzeiger](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Reichsanzeiger)). The latest results with text from more than 700000 pages are available [online](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/periodika/en/imperial-gazette/ocr/).

## Tesseract installer for Windows

Normally we run Tesseract on Debian GNU Linux, but there was also the need for
a Windows version. That's why we have built a Tesseract installer for Windows.

**WARNING: Tesseract should be either installed in the directory which is suggested during the installation or in a new directory. The uninstaller removes the whole installation directory. If you installed Tesseract in an existing directory, that directory will be removed with all its subdirectories and files.**

The latest installer can be downloaded here:
* [tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.3.1.20230401.exe](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.3.1.20230401.exe) (64 bit)

There are also [older versions for 32 and 64 bit Windows](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/) available.

In addition, we also provide [documentation](https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/doc/) which was generated by Doxygen.

## Tesseract models for historic prints

Historic books printed in Fraktur script are supported by the standard models _frk_ and _script/Fraktur_.
In addition we [trained our own models](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesstrain/wiki/GT4HistOCR) on a wide range of historic books. They are available [online](https://ub-backup.bib.uni-mannheim.de/~stweil/tesstrain/). In many cases the results from those models (_Fraktur_5000000_, _frak2021_) are better than those from the standard models.

Hint: Old versions of the installer had an option to add Tesseract to the PATH environment variable. That option was disabled by default. If it was enabled and PATH was very long, it could happen that the new PATH was empty. We suggest not to use that option and disabled it in our latest version.
